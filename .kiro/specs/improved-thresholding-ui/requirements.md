# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The thresholding window in the Parameter application currently has usability issues. Users report that controls get cut off at the bottom of the analysis window, and clicking on thresholding results in multiple windows opening, creating a crowded and confusing interface. This feature aims to improve the thresholding window's user interface to make it more user-friendly, better organized, and visually appealing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Improved Layout and Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all thresholding controls to be visible without scrolling or getting cut off, so that I can access all functionality easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the thresholding window is opened THEN all controls SHALL be fully visible without requiring scrolling
2. WHEN the window is resized THEN the controls SHALL adapt to maintain visibility
3. IF the screen resolution is too small to display all controls THEN the application SHALL provide a scrollable interface with clear visual indicators

### Requirement 2: Consolidated Window Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want thresholding operations to be contained within a single window or organized view, so that I don't have multiple overlapping windows cluttering my screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects thresholding functionality THEN the application SHALL display all related controls and previews in a single organized window or tabbed interface
2. WHEN different thresholding methods are selected THEN the interface SHALL update dynamically without creating new windows
3. IF multiple views are necessary THEN they SHALL be organized in tabs or panels within a single window frame

### Requirement 3: Intuitive Control Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want thresholding controls to be logically grouped and labeled, so that I can easily understand and use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the thresholding window is displayed THEN controls SHALL be organized into logical groups with clear headings
2. WHEN a thresholding method is selected THEN only relevant controls for that method SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN hovering over controls THEN tooltips SHALL provide additional information about their function

### Requirement 4: Responsive Preview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see immediate visual feedback when adjusting thresholding parameters, so that I can understand the effect of my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a thresholding parameter is adjusted THEN the preview image SHALL update in real-time
2. WHEN switching between thresholding methods THEN the preview SHALL update immediately to reflect the new method
3. IF processing takes more than 0.5 seconds THEN a visual indicator SHALL show that processing is in progress

### Requirement 5: Persistent Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want my thresholding settings to be preserved between sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure them each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is closed THEN the current thresholding settings SHALL be saved
2. WHEN the application is reopened THEN the previously saved thresholding settings SHALL be restored
3. IF a user wants to reset to default settings THEN a reset option SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Accessible Preset Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy access to thresholding presets, so that I can quickly apply common configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the thresholding window is open THEN presets SHALL be easily accessible through a dropdown or dedicated panel
2. WHEN a preset is selected THEN all relevant parameters SHALL be updated immediately
3. WHEN a user creates a custom configuration THEN they SHALL be able to save it as a new preset with a custom name
