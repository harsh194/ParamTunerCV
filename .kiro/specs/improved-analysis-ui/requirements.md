# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Parameter application's analysis control window currently has usability issues that need to be addressed. Users report that controls are getting cut off at the bottom of the window, and clicking on options like thresholding results in multiple windows opening, creating a crowded and confusing interface. This feature aims to improve the analysis control window to make it more user-friendly, better organized, and more visually appealing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analysis control window to display all controls properly without cutting off content, so that I can access all functionality without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis window is opened THEN all UI controls SHALL be fully visible without being cut off
2. WHEN the window size changes THEN the UI SHALL adapt responsively to maintain visibility of all controls
3. IF the content exceeds the available space THEN scrollbars SHALL be provided to access all content
4. WHEN the user resizes the window THEN the layout SHALL adjust appropriately to the new dimensions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want thresholding and other analysis functions to be contained within a single organized window, so that I don't have multiple windows cluttering my screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects thresholding or other analysis functions THEN the functionality SHALL be displayed within the main analysis window
2. WHEN switching between different analysis functions THEN only relevant controls SHALL be shown while maintaining a single window interface
3. IF multiple views are necessary THEN they SHALL be organized as tabs or panels within the same window
4. WHEN the user closes the analysis window THEN all related sub-windows SHALL also close

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and intuitive layout for the analysis controls, so that I can easily find and use the functions I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis window is opened THEN controls SHALL be logically grouped by function
2. WHEN using the interface THEN related controls SHALL be visually connected through consistent design elements
3. IF advanced options are available THEN they SHALL be organized in expandable/collapsible sections
4. WHEN hovering over controls THEN tooltips SHALL provide additional information about their function

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when adjusting analysis parameters, so that I can immediately see the effects of my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameter values are changed THEN visual updates SHALL occur in real-time when computationally feasible
2. WHEN processing takes longer than 0.5 seconds THEN visual indicators SHALL show that processing is in progress
3. IF a parameter change results in an error THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN multiple parameters are adjusted simultaneously THEN the system SHALL efficiently batch updates to maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to save and load my analysis configurations, so that I can reuse effective settings without manual reconfiguration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to save a configuration THEN a simple interface SHALL allow naming and saving the current settings
2. WHEN the user wants to load a configuration THEN a list of saved configurations SHALL be easily accessible
3. IF a configuration is loaded THEN all relevant controls SHALL update to reflect the loaded settings
4. WHEN configurations are saved THEN they SHALL persist between application sessions
