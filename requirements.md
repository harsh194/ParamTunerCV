# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing parameter repository from a monolithic single-file structure to a well-organized, modular, top-class repository architecture. The current `parameter.py` file contains over 1600 lines with multiple classes handling different concerns. The goal is to separate these into logical modules while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing code like `check.py`.

## Requirements
all 
### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the parameter library, I want the codebase to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same public API as the current monolithic implementation
2. WHEN importing from the main module THEN all existing import statements SHALL continue to work without modification
3. WHEN `check.py` is executed THEN it SHALL run identically to the current implementation without any code changes
4. WHEN the library is used THEN all functionality SHALL behave exactly as before the refactoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the parameter library, I want classes to be separated into focused modules, so that I can work on specific functionality without navigating through unrelated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each class SHALL be in its own dedicated module file
2. WHEN a class has a specific responsibility THEN it SHALL be grouped with related functionality in appropriate packages
3. WHEN looking at any module THEN it SHALL contain only classes and functions related to its specific domain
4. WHEN the project structure is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow Python packaging best practices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer extending the parameter library, I want clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily identify where to add new functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding GUI-related features THEN there SHALL be a dedicated GUI package for such modifications
2. WHEN adding image processing features THEN there SHALL be a dedicated processing package for such modifications
3. WHEN adding configuration features THEN there SHALL be a dedicated configuration module for such modifications
4. WHEN adding utility functions THEN there SHALL be a dedicated utilities package for such modifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the parameter library, I want the installation and usage to remain unchanged, so that existing projects continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the library THEN the installation process SHALL remain the same
2. WHEN importing classes THEN the import statements SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN using factory functions THEN they SHALL be available from the same import paths
4. WHEN accessing any public API THEN it SHALL be available from the same locations as before

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the parameter library, I want proper package initialization, so that all modules are properly accessible and dependencies are managed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the main package THEN all public classes SHALL be automatically available
2. WHEN optional dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with appropriate warnings
3. WHEN modules have interdependencies THEN they SHALL be properly resolved through the package structure
4. WHEN the package is imported THEN initialization SHALL handle all necessary setup automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contributor to the parameter library, I want the codebase to follow modern Python packaging standards, so that the project is professional and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL follow standard Python package layout conventions
2. WHEN looking at module organization THEN it SHALL use appropriate `__init__.py` files for package management
3. WHEN reviewing imports THEN they SHALL use relative imports within the package where appropriate
4. WHEN checking the main module THEN it SHALL serve as a clean entry point that re-exports all public APIs
