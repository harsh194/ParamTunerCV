# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive docstrings throughout the Parameter project codebase. The goal is to establish a consistent, high-quality documentation standard for all classes and functions, similar to those found in professional repositories of major companies. These docstrings will improve code readability, maintainability, and facilitate better understanding of the codebase for both current and future developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all classes to have comprehensive docstrings, so that I can quickly understand their purpose, behavior, and usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any class in the codebase THEN the system SHALL provide a docstring that clearly describes the class's purpose.
2. WHEN reading a class docstring THEN the system SHALL include information about the class's responsibilities and role within the system.
3. WHEN reading a class docstring THEN the system SHALL list all important attributes with their types and descriptions.
4. WHEN reading a class docstring THEN the system SHALL include usage examples for common scenarios.
5. WHEN a class inherits from another class THEN the system SHALL mention the parent class and any overridden behavior.
6. WHEN a class is part of a design pattern THEN the system SHALL mention the pattern and the class's role within it.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all functions and methods to have detailed docstrings, so that I can understand their inputs, outputs, and behavior without reading the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any function or method THEN the system SHALL provide a docstring that clearly describes its purpose.
2. WHEN reading a function docstring THEN the system SHALL include descriptions of all parameters with their types.
3. WHEN reading a function docstring THEN the system SHALL describe the return value with its type.
4. WHEN a function can raise exceptions THEN the system SHALL document all possible exceptions and their trigger conditions.
5. WHEN a function has side effects THEN the system SHALL document these effects.
6. WHEN a function has preconditions or postconditions THEN the system SHALL document these conditions.
7. WHEN a function is complex THEN the system SHALL include usage examples.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent docstring format across the entire codebase, so that I can quickly locate specific information within any docstring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining docstrings across different files THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent format and structure.
2. WHEN reading docstrings THEN the system SHALL follow the Google Python Style Guide format.
3. WHEN reading docstrings THEN the system SHALL use consistent section ordering (description, parameters, returns, raises, examples).
4. WHEN reading docstrings THEN the system SHALL use consistent indentation and spacing.
5. WHEN reading docstrings THEN the system SHALL use consistent terminology for similar concepts.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type hints in both the function signatures and docstrings, so that I can understand the expected types without ambiguity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining a function signature THEN the system SHALL include Python type hints for all parameters and return values.
2. WHEN reading a function docstring THEN the system SHALL include type information that is consistent with the signature type hints.
3. WHEN complex types are used THEN the system SHALL provide detailed type descriptions in the docstring.
4. WHEN using container types THEN the system SHALL specify the contained types (e.g., List[str], Dict[str, int]).
5. WHEN using union types THEN the system SHALL clearly document all possible types and when each might occur.
6. WHEN using optional parameters THEN the system SHALL mark them as Optional[type] and document default values.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want module-level docstrings that explain the purpose and contents of each module, so that I can quickly understand the module's role in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any Python module THEN the system SHALL provide a module-level docstring.
2. WHEN reading a module docstring THEN the system SHALL include a brief description of the module's purpose.
3. WHEN reading a module docstring THEN the system SHALL list the main classes and functions contained within.
4. WHEN a module is part of a larger package THEN the system SHALL explain how it fits into the overall architecture.
5. WHEN a module has dependencies THEN the system SHALL list important external dependencies.
6. WHEN a module contains examples THEN the system SHALL include them in the module docstring.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want docstrings to include performance considerations and algorithmic complexity, so that I can make informed decisions about using specific functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function has significant performance implications THEN the system SHALL document its time complexity (Big O notation).
2. WHEN a function has significant memory usage THEN the system SHALL document its space complexity.
3. WHEN a function has performance caveats or edge cases THEN the system SHALL document these considerations.
4. WHEN alternative implementations exist with different performance characteristics THEN the system SHALL mention these alternatives.
