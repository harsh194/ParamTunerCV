# Design Document: Comprehensive Docstrings Implementation

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for implementing comprehensive docstrings throughout the Parameter project codebase. The goal is to establish a consistent, high-quality documentation standard for all classes, methods, functions, and modules that follows industry best practices and enhances code readability and maintainability.

## Architecture

The implementation of comprehensive docstrings will follow a non-invasive approach that preserves the existing functionality while enhancing the documentation. The docstrings will be added to all code elements without changing their behavior or signatures.

### Documentation Format

We will adopt the Google Python Style Guide format for docstrings, which is widely used in industry and provides a clear, readable structure. This format includes:

1. A concise description of the purpose of the class/function/method
2. Args/Parameters section with type information
3. Returns section with type information
4. Raises section for exceptions
5. Examples section for usage demonstrations

## Components and Interfaces

### Module-Level Docstrings

Each Python module will include a module-level docstring that:

1. Describes the purpose and functionality of the module
2. Lists the main classes and functions contained within
3. Explains how the module fits into the overall architecture
4. Provides usage examples where appropriate

Example:
```python
"""
Image export functionality for the Parameter project.

This module provides capabilities for exporting analysis data to various formats
including JSON and CSV. It handles different types of data such as histograms,
pixel profiles, and polygon coordinates.

Main Classes:
    - ExportManager: Handles the export of analysis data to different file formats

Usage:
    export_manager = ExportManager()
    export_manager.export_analysis_data('histogram', histogram_data, 'json', 'my_histogram')
"""
```

### Class Docstrings

Each class will include a comprehensive docstring that:

1. Describes the purpose and responsibility of the class
2. Lists important attributes with types and descriptions
3. Explains the class's role within the system
4. Provides usage examples
5. Mentions parent classes and design patterns where applicable

Example:
```python
class ExportManager:
    """
    Manages the export of analysis data to various file formats.
    
    This class provides methods to export different types of analysis data
    (histograms, profiles, polygons) to common file formats like JSON and CSV.
    It handles the formatting and serialization of data appropriate to each
    export format.
    
    Attributes:
        None
    
    Examples:
        >>> export_manager = ExportManager()
        >>> histogram_data = {'red': [10, 20, 30], 'green': [5, 15, 25]}
        >>> export_manager.export_histogram_data(histogram_data, 'json', 'my_histogram')
    """
```

### Method and Function Docstrings

Each method and function will include a comprehensive docstring that:

1. Describes the purpose and behavior
2. Lists all parameters with types and descriptions
3. Describes the return value with type
4. Documents exceptions that may be raised
5. Provides usage examples for complex functions
6. Documents performance considerations where relevant

Example:
```python
def export_histogram_data(self, histogram_data: Dict[str, List[int]], format: str = 'json', filename: str = 'histogram_export') -> bool:
    """
    Export histogram data to a file in the specified format.
    
    This method takes histogram data as a dictionary where keys are channel names
    and values are lists of intensity counts. It then exports this data to either
    JSON or CSV format.
    
    Args:
        histogram_data: Dictionary with channel names as keys and intensity counts as values.
            Each value should be a list of integers representing the histogram bins.
        format: Export format, either 'json' or 'csv'. Defaults to 'json'.
        filename: Base filename without extension. Defaults to 'histogram_export'.
            
    Returns:
        bool: True if export was successful, False otherwise.
        
    Raises:
        IOError: If the file cannot be written to disk.
        ValueError: If the histogram_data is not in the expected format.
        
    Examples:
        >>> histogram_data = {'red': [10, 20, 30], 'green': [5, 15, 25]}
        >>> export_manager.export_histogram_data(histogram_data, 'json', 'my_histogram')
        True
        
    Performance:
        Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of histogram bins across all channels.
        Space Complexity: O(n) for temporary storage during CSV conversion.
    """
```

## Data Models

No new data models will be introduced as part of this implementation. The docstrings will document the existing data structures and their usage patterns.

## Error Handling

The docstrings will document all exceptions that may be raised by functions and methods, including:

1. The specific exception types
2. The conditions under which they are raised
3. How to handle or prevent these exceptions

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Review

Each docstring will be manually reviewed to ensure:

1. Accuracy of the information
2. Consistency with the code implementation
3. Adherence to the Google Python Style Guide format
4. Completeness of the documentation

### Documentation Tools

We will use tools like `pydocstyle` to verify that docstrings follow the Google Python Style Guide format and are present for all public classes, methods, and functions.

### Integration with IDE

The docstrings will be designed to work well with IDE features like:

1. Hover documentation
2. Auto-completion suggestions
3. Parameter hints

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Components

Start with documenting the core components that form the foundation of the system:

1. `ImageViewer` class in `src/core/image_viewer.py`
2. `ViewerConfig` class in `src/config/viewer_config.py`

### Phase 2: Analysis Components

Document the analysis components that provide data processing capabilities:

1. `ExportManager` class in `src/analysis/export/export_manager.py`
2. Other analysis-related classes and functions

### Phase 3: UI and Event Components

Document the UI and event handling components:

1. `MouseHandler` class in `src/events/mouse_handler.py`
2. `TrackbarManager` class in `src/controls/trackbar_manager.py`
3. `WindowManager` class in `src/gui/window_manager.py`

### Phase 4: Utility Components

Document utility functions and factory methods:

1. Functions in `src/utils/` directory

## Design Decisions

### Google Style vs. NumPy Style

We chose the Google Python Style Guide format over alternatives like NumPy style because:

1. It's more readable for both humans and IDEs
2. It's widely adopted in industry
3. It provides a clear structure for different documentation sections
4. It works well with tools like Sphinx for generating documentation

### Type Hints in Docstrings and Signatures

We will include type hints both in function signatures (using Python's typing module) and in docstrings to:

1. Provide redundancy for better understanding
2. Support older tools that may not recognize Python's type hints
3. Allow for more detailed type descriptions in the docstrings

### Performance Documentation

We will include performance considerations in docstrings for functions where performance is a significant concern, using:

1. Big O notation for time complexity
2. Space complexity information
3. Notes about edge cases or performance caveats

This will help developers make informed decisions about using these functions in performance-critical contexts.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive docstring implementation will significantly improve the readability, maintainability, and usability of the Parameter project codebase. By following industry best practices and providing detailed information about all code elements, we will make it easier for current and future developers to understand and work with the codebase.
